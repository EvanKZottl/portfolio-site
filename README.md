# Portfolio Site

A minimal, clean personal portfolio (HTML/CSS/JS) to showcase projects in **Power BI, Excel, SQL**, and web.

## Local preview

Open `index.html` in your browser or use VS Code Live Server.

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

1. Push this repo to GitHub (use `main` as default branch).
2. Pages auto-deploys via the included workflow on each push to `main`.
3. After the first run, your site URL will appear in the **Actions** run summary and under **Settings → Pages**.

If Pages is disabled on your account/org, enable it: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions.
